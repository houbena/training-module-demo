# Introduction

This a short training module made by me using Docker, Katacoda, and simple editing tools such as Keynote, iMovie.

The topic of this module is about building container images. This module distinguish itself from other modules that handle the same topic. Beyond the basic knowledge, it provides **best practices**, **troubleshooting** and explains the **concepts** while most learning modules stick to the simple how-to approach.  

# Contents

This module includes:

- videos,
- presentations based on slides
- a live demo
- a question set
- and an exercise.

All the content is enumerated.

The module starts with a brief introductory video (Nr. 0) and a short description of the module (1).

Video (2) explains the nature of images.

Video (3) talks about the methods of building images.

Videos (4) and (5) focus on the interactive method of building images.

Videos (6) and (7) deal with the method of building images with Dockerfiles.

The learning module ends with a set of comprehension / self evaluation questions added here in the document (8).

And finally the hands-on exercise focuses on building images with dockerfiles. This exercise is documented in the document (9) and also formatted as a Katacoda scenario [here](https://www.katacoda.com/houssein/scenarios/build-images).

# Structure

# Constraints / TODOs

- Add more text content and further reading resources for every subsection, for those who like to read and ho beyond the course material.

- More crucial Dockerfile instructions can be introcuded, such as `ENTRYPOUNT` and `COPY`, as well as concepts to build more efficient images.
