# Learning Module Demo: Building Container Images

## Introduction

This a short training module made by me using Docker, Katacoda, and simple editing tools such as Keynote, iMovie.

The topic of this module is about building container images. This module distinguish itself from other modules that handle the same topic. Beyond the basic knowledge, it provides **best practices**, **troubleshooting** and explains the **concepts** while most learning modules stick to the simple how-to approach.  

## Contents

This module includes:

- videos,
- presentations based on slides
- a live demo
- a question set
- and an exercise.

All the content is enumerated.

The module starts with a brief introductory video (Nr. 0) and a short description of the module (1).

Video (2) explains the nature of images.

Video (3) talks about the methods of building images.

Videos (4) and (5) focus on the interactive method of building images.

Videos (6) and (7) deal with the method of building images with Dockerfiles.

The learning module ends with a set of comprehension / self evaluation questions added here in the document (8).

And finally the hands-on exercise focuses on building images with dockerfiles. This exercise is documented in the document (9) and also formatted as a Katacoda scenario [here](https://www.katacoda.com/houssein/scenarios/build-images).

## Tentative Structure

The rough structure of the module looks like the following:

- Introduction
	- 00 Welcome
	- 01 Description
- Definitions
	- 02 The Nature of Images
	- 03 Methods of Building Images
- Building Images Interactively
	- 04 drawing
	- 05 demo
- Building Images with Dockerfiles
	- 06 What are Dockerfiles
	- 07 How Images are Built
- Self-Evaluation
	- 08 Questions
	- 09 Hands-on Exercise

## Constraints / TODOs

- Add more text content and further reading resources for every subsection, for those who like to read and ho beyond the course material.

- Add more technical details, in this example further useful Dockerfile instructions can be introcuded, such as `ENTRYPOUNT` and `COPY`, as well as concepts to build more efficient images.

- Add feedback elements to the student such as:
	- Feedback at the end of the self evaluation section.
	- trainer appears in the middle of the module to give feedback.
	- Add an outro for the module / transition to the next module.

- Add a feedback elements to the course developer, such as:
	- short survey at the end or quick comprehension questions between modules/units.
	- Add a discussion element under every unit. Usually learning units that include errors or that are not explained well receive more comments from students.
	
	
- The instructor should lead students in the videos:
	- tell them where to go next
	- Introduce the next topic
	- Ask them to answer questions / take teh survey
	- etc.

- In self paced courses, the learning material should be able - or at least try - to cover the instructors job. The instructions must includes troubleshooting, hints and best practices. For the demo purpose this module includes some, but it lacks many.

- Anything else?
